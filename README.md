Client-server app with mqtt protocol.
App was made to mock the process of reading physical card with employee's id and sending it to the server.
Clients are meant to be card readers that send information about read id and time when the card was scanned.
Server allows to manage the list of employees and card ids and also allows to generate raports on how much time specific employees worked.
